A simple 2D guessing game to practice while loops and if statements. 
The user guesses a number, and the code runs it against a randomly generated secret number. 
If after three tries of guessing, the user fails to guess the secret number the code breaks and a game over message is printed.
However, if the user guesses correctly the code breaks and a congratulatory message is printed.
After each round of guessing, the user is informed of how many tries they have left
